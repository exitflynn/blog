      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-the-google-summer-of-code&#34; &gt;What is The Google Summer of Code?
&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a program by Google for promoting students to contribute to open-source communities.
It is also a  G R E A T  opportunity for us to work on projects with such big impact. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I came to know about it. I loved that I could get this opportunity to work with
Now one could argue that that&amp;rsquo;s the opportunity Open-Source provides in general, which is true. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to admit but I did need that initial push, some motivating factor to &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; make the effort and get my hands wet with contributing to an open-source project. However it&amp;rsquo;s as they say, the beginning&amp;rsquo;s the hardest part and that once you start contributing it becomes so much more easy to keep going. I think they&amp;rsquo;ve done a great job at incentivising Open-Source contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;choosing-an-org&#34; &gt;Choosing an Org
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#choosing-an-org&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of Organisations participate in GSoC. I had worked on a couple of #good-first-issues on a few projects before this period and had achieved that level of confidence where the language / tech-stack wasn&amp;rsquo;t the deciding factor for me anymore but it was now the project idea / the community.
I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; Astronomy and feel quite strongly about it. I am super-curious about how I can use my skills / to-be skills in tech in the field of Astronomy, some sort of an intersection of the two would actually be one of the most meaningful and enjoyable work I could find for myself.
Naturally, I looked into &lt;strong&gt;OpenAstronomy&lt;/strong&gt; as a GSoC org.
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of people prioritising those organisations which make for nicer addition to a resume from a product-based tech companies pov and it indeed &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a very smart way to go about it to be honest but I decided that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss this unique opportunity to work on something I had wanted to do since a long time.
Under the sub-orgs for OpenAstronomy, I found &lt;strong&gt;SunPy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-experience-with-sunpy&#34; &gt;First Experience with SunPy
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#first-experience-with-sunpy&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, SunPy is a python library relating to solar physics. Though heliophysics wasn&amp;rsquo;t exactly something that I thought of when thinking of astrophysics or space-stuff, I was &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; impressed by how active and supportive the community is. Besides, I found myself interested in the networking side of things more than the solar-physics stuff anyways as for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While first going through the issues I came across one which included &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/issues/6692&#34;&gt;detecting gzipped files from more than just the extension&lt;/a&gt; (via file-signatures / magic-bytes). I love when my familairity with using linux-based systems comes into play during development and I felt the issue to be quite approachable. During the PR Review, I remember going through the documentation for python&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;gzip&lt;/code&gt; module to verify that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to decompress a whole gzipped file and that we could decompress just enough to get the first couple of bits which include the file-signature (since otherwise it&amp;rsquo;d mean way too much overhead for the solution to be practical) and information on that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; as easily available on the web as I&amp;rsquo;d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;subsequent-experience&#34; &gt;Subsequent Experience

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept on making code-contributions which I felt approachable for some parts of January and February. And then I got a bit busy due to some health-reasons and college and organsing OSDHack &amp;lsquo;23 (I&amp;rsquo;ll totally write a blog-post on that later, it was such a nice success). I was a bit apprehensive because I was also looking forward to participate in the Google Summer of Code as a SunPy contributor and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to give off the wrong impression so I wrote a (not)brief text to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Nabobalis&#34;&gt;Nabil&lt;/a&gt; who was super-supportive. When the proposal submission period came around, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the most ideal process since I ended up having to make the proposal in the last 2 days. Thankfully again, the community is super responsive and I reached out to both Nabil and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wtbarnes&#34;&gt;Will&lt;/a&gt; for some feedback on my proposal and they both replied immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;contributing-to-open-source-is-goated&#34; &gt;Contributing to Open-Source is GOATed
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#contributing-to-open-source-is-goated&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in tech / software development should actually be talking about this so much more than they are. Some of the things that come to my mind right now are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-a-great-way-to-learn-stuff&#34; &gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to learn stuff
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#its-a-great-way-to-learn-stuff&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main factors why I think people have a hard time contributing is that they think &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t contribute here because I don&amp;rsquo;t know nearly enough tech to do stuff&amp;rdquo;. The thing with being involved in this form of software development is that it gets you used to learning on the fly which is central to software development and doing well in any field, tbh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributing to big open-source projects helped me gained TREMENDOUS self-confidence. I could look at any issue on any repo now, and never think that it&amp;rsquo;s un-doable. No matter what domain or what language the project is in, it&amp;rsquo;s only a question of how much time it&amp;rsquo;d take to get through the relevant documentation and concepts. This is certainly a long way from &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t do $#!+ in this codebase if my life depended on it, it scares me&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;m very much glad I could have this experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-best-practices-ever&#34; &gt;The best practices ever
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-best-practices-ever&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get to learn how to write well-tested, well-documented and maintainable Production-Ready code following the best software development practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-get-to-choose-what-you-want-to-work-on&#34; &gt;You get to choose what you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to work on

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;YEP! And most of the communities would love to have you work on it, that&amp;rsquo;s such an exciting thing if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(this post is a bit rough around the edges, I definitely want to add stuff to it but owing to my exams right now I&amp;rsquo;ll get to it at some later point of time, thanks for reading!)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;before-i-start&#34; &gt;before i start
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#before-i-start&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;you may have seen the length of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like as in i’ve just copy-pasted the rough-incomplete-pointers-at-the-end incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you may ask why that is, it’s because it’s RAM’s 10th anniversary today which’ll end in exactly 5 mins in my timezone, i want to get this out before that happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;whats-random-access-memories&#34; &gt;what’s random access memories?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#whats-random-access-memories&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;it’s a p cool album from Daft Punk, it’s very nice. I recommend you listen to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but also not. realistically speaking i doubt you’d like it as much as i do. To most listeners, most of the tracks would be off-putting at the first listen. I have a particular affinity to electronic music, that’s the something that had me coming back to the album. No matter how weird most of it sound, I’d still come back for the pop-oriented Get Lucky or Instant Crush. The way my music taste developed over the years definitely played a part in it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But different people have different things that strike out to them. And who knows, maybe you’re going through the tracks and there’s something you recognise there and connect to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s RAM like?
it’s electronic… well kinda because you see&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s also orchestra… well kinda since it’s not your traditional orchestra. You see,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s dance music… but not your avg dance music,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s more soulful… but that still doesn’t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s all of these things, and more, at once. and it’a perfected to perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s about having fun, having &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) , falling in love, getting your heart-broken, dancing, the essence and the evolution of dance music and the life-story of one of its pioneers, whatever the fuck motherboard is about, contact&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s about music, falling in love, falling out of love, having fun, having fun (with a wink), what it is to be human (from the perspective of a robot) and, well, memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if classical music kept adapting with all the sounds and techniques that technology unlocked, RAM would be the Moonlight Sonata of our age.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those tracks which had vocals going for it, but i disliked initially despite that. On my first listen-through i felt that it’s got a wholesome cheery vibe without much depth which I still believe is true, especially since I was coming from the more&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Touch gets a lot of attention as &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; song but there’s a good reason that a lot of fans may give that title to Giorgio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking objectively, it’s easily one of the most unique tracks I’ve ever listened to. Definitely recommend you head over and give it a listen real quick. Perfect example of the song that sounded so &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt; on the first listen, I gave up straight away. Couple of months later and it’s easily one of the most heartfelt and innovative and inspiring tracks that I actually love listening to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From finding something as too weird to listen to only to have it be one of my favorites later on, listening to Daft Punk has been an adventure alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;combine all of music. electronic but you have choir vocals, orchestra, piano, lead human vocals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it’s the song you try not to bring up because it’s too good. it’s the song you don’t want to mention on your social-fucking-media&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;contact. i dont understand it. does represent the future&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you listen to the song you’ve been avoiding and it’ll be on your repeat for the next 3-weeks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you settle on a favourite until you listen to something else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;proper analysis i won’t do, tbh i’d say things like there are “subtle drops” but i fear the more i do the more it’ll end up sucking, the exp would be ruined&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Been &lt;em&gt;obsessed&lt;/em&gt; with Watchmen. The original Graphic Novel and the show. I feel weird about the show. Almost like it changes my perception and the safe model I had of Watchmen universe until I saw it. Kind of like how everyone felt when they heard about Dr. Manhattan. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to have to decide how I want to think about the phenomenally earth-shatteringly great universe set up by the original Graphic Novel. Whether I want to consider the show canon or not, for despite it&amp;rsquo;s better-than-expected writing and execution, it does fall flat in some areas and even the tiniest bit of imperfection stands out when previously you were having trouble wrapping your head around the perfection of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ll see the show as a different universe all together, where the message of the original comic changes(?) taking the show in consideration.
In fact, I should be grateful to be presented this opportunity to deal with something I&amp;rsquo;ve been avoiding since long.
Why should it matter? Why should including the show in my mental model have any impact on the show? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I myself be able to determine whether Dr. Manhattan could have done more? Just how much of an unlikeabe character Rorshach really was?
Well, a) because of the expository nature of some character&amp;rsquo;s nature ofcourse, exposition, almost by definition, is something you can&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;reason out&amp;rdquo;. I can&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s out of character for Laurie to become so &amp;ldquo;headstrong&amp;rdquo; and assertive, since like it or not, that&amp;rsquo;s what ends up happening. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit the character model you had in your mind, treat this as new information. Who&amp;rsquo;s to say you knew everything there was to know about these characters? Sure, as far as Laurie&amp;rsquo;s character development is concerned there were definitely signs and possibilities given her mother&amp;rsquo;s personality as she grew up but there&amp;rsquo;s no way to confirm it and believe that everything that happens now I should attribute to the same character in my head. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t look at Laurie in the comic and think that this is the same character that&amp;rsquo;d go on to become a reckless and cocksure cop. Same way I can&amp;rsquo;t be sure that Manhattan would come back to Earth so soon to fall in love and gladly accept a death like that (though now that I think of it, given Manhattan&amp;rsquo;s consciousness across time, all of these events &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; kinda-sorta compatible with the comic).
Which brings me to a point I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to just come to for a long period of time, just think of the show as Lindelof&amp;rsquo;s version of Watchmen, as a weird, fucked-up altered universe in the multiverse and think of Alan Moore&amp;rsquo;s version as just that, as the masterpiece it is.
Some questions that Lindelof&amp;rsquo;s alternate version raises &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; carry over to Moore&amp;rsquo;s and should apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the show&amp;rsquo;s existence breaking my reality overshadowed my utter obsession with the themes and ideas of the original novel. Rorshach, Comedian, Manhattan and Ozymandias. Such thought-provoking writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, obsessed with Watchmen. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross&amp;rsquo; soundtrack to Watchmen, and by extension, Soul as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose I shall take a break from Watchmen. I have overdone the thing and soon I&amp;rsquo;ll keep going gaga over a superficial understanding of something that is unrealistic at the end of the day. The ideas explored are pretty good and thought-provoking sure but I&amp;rsquo;m only defiling their effect by placing them on a altar higher than I should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They just announced a Scott Pilgrim show.
So there&amp;rsquo;s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also yeah, GSoC time chal rha hai. Have to write my proposal. Can&amp;rsquo;t seem to haha :skull:. Also T2 ke liye bhi padhna chahiye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also obsessed about this girl as of late. And the situation&amp;rsquo;s super awkward, like cringey how weird and awkward it is.
I can&amp;rsquo;t decide how to think about this. Though it&amp;rsquo;s mostly the more straightforward path to remove myself from a situation as messed up and weird as this, I can&amp;rsquo;t because maybe, this girl might like me! And I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much I can bank on that. I suppose I could let it go but I also feel like I can&amp;rsquo;t afford to miss out on her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALSO I&amp;rsquo;M KINDA TRIPPING BALLS ABOUT PHILOSOPHY AND SHIT TOO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jean-Paul Sartre, Camus, Kant, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mentoring a Project in Kharagpur Winter of Code</title>
      <link>https://exitflynn.github.io/blog/posts/kwoc/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 10:10:10 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://exitflynn.github.io/blog/posts/kwoc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kharagpur Winter of Code is an annual five week long program where students new or unknown to free and open-source software contribute to coding projects registered in the program by experienced mentors or project owners and gain experience in contributing to open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All credit to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ossdevs.com&#34;&gt;JOOS&lt;/a&gt; (JODC and OSDC) folks for introducing me to the program. I liked what the program was about and had my fingers crossed throughout the year, looking forward to participate when the time came. Someone &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; post about the program a week prior to its start and sure I was reminded, yes, but since this is endsem exams season, one shall be excused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-then-one-day&#34; &gt;And then, one day&amp;hellip;
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#and-then-one-day&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t blame me for not reminding the exam timeline but the day I&amp;rsquo;m talking about here was (or atleast what should&amp;rsquo;ve been haha :wink:) a day of great stress for someone who&amp;rsquo;s used to putting-off work till the last moment. idk like 3 days before first exam maybe.&lt;/em&gt;
As I sat there in the college library, laptop on, I get a text from &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;OsBins&lt;/a&gt; if I could quickly put up an Instagram story from OSDC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&#34;&gt;InstaGram account&lt;/a&gt; (not linking to it, too much promotion for a blog post).
It took an attosecond,
an attosecond for me to register that information and another to realise that &lt;code&gt;winter is here&lt;/code&gt;. I checked and it was the last day for applying as mentor and I quickly pulled up some of the personal projects I had been working on as of late. DeGrasse was the obvious choice, cleaned the ol&amp;rsquo; fella up a bit. The entire world will be watching him now. Don&amp;rsquo;t want to look too unprofesh, went ahead and registered the Discord bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s note to self: please start drafting the MVP first, bc details ke chakkar me saari energy shuru ke paras me hi nikal jaati hai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;kwoc&#34; &gt;KWoC
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#kwoc&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience on the whole was very much fun. Set-up a Discord server for communication. People joined. Discussed about all the features we could implement in the bot (most of which are still to-be implemented), shitposted (&lt;em&gt;on occasion&lt;/em&gt;) and just got to know each other better. This was, by far, the best part of the program for me. I got the chance to interact with people I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have much reason to do so with and I&amp;rsquo;m extremely glad I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most contributors weren&amp;rsquo;t as familiar with python and contributing to open-source. Non-Code contributions really helped here with getting a good idea of the whole &lt;code&gt;setting up git -&amp;gt; forking &amp;amp; cloning -&amp;gt; staging, commiting and pushing -&amp;gt; PR&lt;/code&gt; process while also being super-accessible to everyone. The contributors pointed out issues and suggestions they came across as they set-up the project and got familiar with the codebase.  Everyone&amp;rsquo;s exam timelines were a major pain-in-the-uh-&lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; but I&amp;rsquo;m extremely proud that everyone was able to make a code contribution as well, however minor.&lt;/p&gt;
