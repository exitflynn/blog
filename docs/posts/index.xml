      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kharagpur Winter of Code is an annual five week long program where students new or unknown to free and open-source software contribute to coding projects registered in the program by experienced mentors or project owners and gain experience in contributing to open source software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All credit to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ossdevs.com&#34;&gt;JOOS&lt;/a&gt; (JODC and OSDC) folks for introducing me to the program. I liked what the program was about and had my fingers crossed throughout the year, looking forward to participate when the time came. Someone &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; post about the program a week prior to its start and sure I was reminded, yes, but since this is endsem exams season, one shall be excused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-then-one-day&#34; &gt;And then, one day&amp;hellip;
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#and-then-one-day&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t blame me for not reminding the exam timeline but the day I&amp;rsquo;m talking about here was (or atleast what should&amp;rsquo;ve been haha :wink:) a day of great stress for someone who&amp;rsquo;s used to putting-off work till the last moment. idk like 3 days before first exam maybe.&lt;/em&gt;
As I sat there in the college library, laptop on, I get a text from &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;OsBins&lt;/a&gt; if I could quickly put up an Instagram story from OSDC&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&#34;&gt;InstaGram account&lt;/a&gt; (not linking to it, too much promotion for a blog post).
It took an attosecond,
an attosecond for me to register that information and another to realise that &lt;code&gt;winter is here&lt;/code&gt;. I checked and it was the last day for applying as mentor and I quickly pulled up some of the personal projects I had been working on as of late. DeGrasse was the obvious choice, cleaned the ol&amp;rsquo; fella up a bit. The entire world will be watching him now. Don&amp;rsquo;t want to look too unprofesh, went ahead and registered the Discord bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Author&amp;rsquo;s note to self: please start drafting the MVP first, bc details ke chakkar me saari energy shuru ke paras me hi nikal jaati hai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;kwoc&#34; &gt;KWoC
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#kwoc&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience on the whole was very much fun. Set-up a Discord server for communication. People joined. Discussed about all the features we could implement in the bot (most of which are still to-be implemented), shitposted (&lt;em&gt;on occasion&lt;/em&gt;) and just got to know each other better. This was, by far, the best part of the program for me. I got the chance to interact with people I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have much reason to do so with and I&amp;rsquo;m extremely glad I did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most contributors weren&amp;rsquo;t as familiar with python and contributing to open-source. Non-Code contributions really helped here with getting a good idea of the whole &lt;code&gt;setting up git -&amp;gt; forking &amp;amp; cloning -&amp;gt; staging, commiting and pushing -&amp;gt; PR&lt;/code&gt; process while also being super-accessible to everyone. The contributors pointed out issues and suggestions they came across as they set-up the project and got familiar with the codebase.  Everyone&amp;rsquo;s exam timelines were a major pain-in-the-uh-&lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt; but I&amp;rsquo;m extremely proud that everyone was able to make a code contribution as well, however minor.&lt;/p&gt;
