> The Kharagpur Winter of Code is an annual five week long program where students new or unknown to free and open-source software contribute to coding projects registered in the program by experienced mentors or project owners and gain experience in contributing to open source software.

All credit to the [JOOS](https://ossdevs.com) (JODC and OSDC) folks for introducing me to the program. I liked what the program was about and had my fingers crossed throughout the year, looking forward to participate when the time came. Someone _did_ post about the program a week prior to its start and sure I was reminded, yes, but since this is endsem exams season, one shall be excused.

## And then, one day...
_Can't blame me for not reminding the exam timeline but the day I'm talking about here was (or atleast what should've been haha :wink:) a day of great stress for someone who's used to putting-off work till the last moment. idk like 3 days before first exam maybe._
As I sat there in the college library, laptop on, I get a text from [OsBins]() if I could quickly put up an Instagram story from OSDC's [InstaGram account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) (not linking to it, too much promotion for a blog post).
It took an attosecond,
an attosecond for me to register that information and another to realise that `winter is here`. I checked and it was the last day for applying as mentor and I quickly pulled up some of the personal projects I had been working on as of late. DeGrasse was the obvious choice, cleaned the ol' fella up a bit. The entire world will be watching him now. Don't want to look too unprofesh, went ahead and registered the Discord bot.

*Author's note to self: please start drafting the MVP first, bc details ke chakkar me saari energy shuru ke paras me hi nikal jaati hai*

The experience on the whole was very much fun. Set-up a Discord server for communication. People joined. Discussed about all the features we could implement in the bot (most of which are still to-be implemented), shitposted (*on occasion*) and just got to know each other better. This was, by far, the best part of the program for me. I got the chance to interact with people I wouldn't have much reason to do so with and I'm extremely glad I did! 

Most contributors weren't as familiar with python and contributing to open-source. Non-Code contributions really helped here with getting a good idea of the whole `setting up git -> forking & cloning -> staging, commiting and pushing -> PR` process while also being super-accessible to everyone. The contributors pointed out issues and suggestions they came across as they set-up the project and got familiar with the codebase.  Everyone's exam timelines were a major pain-in-the-uh-`bash` but I'm extremely proud that everyone was able to make a code contribution as well, however minor.
