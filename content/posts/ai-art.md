I had a couple of thoughts about the AI thing going on and I just couldn't find an appropriate forum to put it in, especially one where I could share and hear from people who I interact with on a daily basis. So I put them here.

This is McDonaldisation of digital goods, this is the creative McDonaldisation. However that would be subscribing to the narrative that AI art in itself is / will forever be low-quality compared to human.

Let's see how McDonaldisation is adopted and then see how it's different this time and how that may affect.

McDonaldisation has always so far been about the little guy, an industry running in the shadows, making its way to unofficial middle-class markets and sellers. This still has a higher socioeconomical and educational barrier. Plus it's going to exist in the borderless cyberspace where anything unethical is within an arms' reach for companies and can more easily been cracked down on. Two questions now, is it necessarily digital and in what ways can it be physical? And how do we address that it's creatively a different, new work which is only inspired by someone and not a copy which is more directly unethical. It's imitation of an "inspired by" XYZ compared to an XYZ.

Let's try to think what we really lose with this current trend: intention. In a Ghibli production, the scene composition, the flow, the mise-en-scene, the cinematography, the character design are (atleast perceived) as deliberate choices in service to the film, everything whether intended or not, can be interpreted to send certain messages or evoke certain feelings in you. That intention is the thing that AI might take away.

The next is of course, work hours. 

This may sound harsh. I've heard people call out tech people from not knowing ethics and though I agree for the most part, balancing empathy with pragmatism would be way more beneficial for us than blind support. We would be as interested in machines making digital art as we would be in reading AI generated poetry. Occasional "whoa look" aside, it'll still be human elements that will make them stand out. I will admit, this idea was evoked in me through another 

People need to be more selective. People need to pay enough attention to know the difference, and frankly not everyone has the time. MCU "slop" movies are still released, and no matter how many of us may complain about absolute cinema a lot of us just have a lot in our lives going on and just go to the theatre to see da movies. Lovers of true cinema can snob all they want but Pushpa 2 is going to provide more enjoyment to people than Interstellar, or for a more international example, more people are going to have fun with Infinity War than anything in your Letterboxd top 50.

I thought more art opens up your brain to see every perspective out there. Anyone who genuinely believes reading non-fiction is for babies probably hasn't taken a lot away from the "better" books they've been reading all along. This is what I'm reminded of when I . I believe there's a forced narrative of "Ghibli vs AI". 

How we think of copyrights in the AI age is an important problem to be solved going forward, and so is the environmental impact. Is it in bad taste given the subject matter of Studio Ghibli's art forms, yes! All valid points for pushing back on this and ones that I'm *strongly* for. But shitting on it from a creative perspective is something I don't get.

It's time we stopped fighting (what is merely a tool of) the future, and embrace it.

I must've totally offended people here, considering this is quite a strong opinion in itself. But the risk of being wrong is one you have to take when trying to do right. The outrage in itself is helpful, it won't have any effect but it's a great show of where our hearts lie. It's wrong but that's why it's so much more human and endearing.
